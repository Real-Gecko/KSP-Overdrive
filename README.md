## Make KSP UI ROCK!!!

### Notes

- KAC keeps active state on some buttons when button is "ON"
so "active" is rendered instead of "onNormal"


- Buttons used as selection grid in

- KAC - settings
- [x] Science! - bottom filter
- EPL - settings menu
- AmpYear - settings, Emergency Shutdown Defaults
- Kramax Autopilot Continued - control modes


- Buttons used as toggles in:

- AmpYear flight UI - Reserve, Subsys buttons


- Buttons used as "accordion" header in:

- Waypoint Manager - waypoints list grouping
- Haystack Continued - grouping by orbiting body


- Adding border to window style interferes with following mods:

- Kramax Autopilot Continued - some window elements
- Chatterer - popup hints
